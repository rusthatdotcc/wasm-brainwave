# Understanding Brainwave Entrainment

Brainwave entrainment is a method to stimulate the brain into entering a specific state by using a pulsing sound, light, or electromagnetic field. This process helps the brain synchronize its brainwave frequencies with the rhythm of external stimuli.

## How It Works

The brain produces electrical pulses in various frequencies, known as brainwaves. These different frequencies correspond to different states of consciousness:

| Brainwave Type | Frequency Range | Associated States |
|----------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Delta          | 0.5-4 Hz        | Deep sleep, healing |
| Theta          | 4-8 Hz          | Deep relaxation, meditation |
| Alpha          | 8-13 Hz         | Relaxed focus, stress reduction |
| Beta           | 13-30 Hz        | Active thinking, concentration |
| Gamma          | 30-100 Hz       | Peak performance, heightened perception |

When presented with a rhythmic stimulus (sound or light), the brain tends to synchronize its electrical activity with that rhythm. This is called the "frequency following response."

## Methods of Audio-Based Entrainment

This project implements two primary methods of audio-based brainwave entrainment:

1. **Binaural Beats**
   - Two slightly different frequencies played in each ear
   - Brain perceives a beat at the difference frequency
   - Requires headphones
   - More subtle effect

2. **Isochronic Tones**
   - Single tone pulsed on and off at a specific rate
   - More pronounced effect than binaural beats
   - Works with or without headphones
   - More noticeable stimulus

## Safety Considerations

While brainwave entrainment is generally safe for most people, there are some important considerations:

- People with epilepsy or seizure disorders should avoid brainwave entrainment
- Start with short sessions (15-30 minutes)
- Begin with higher frequencies (alpha/beta) before trying lower ones
- If you experience discomfort, stop immediately
- Avoid using while driving or operating machinery

## Scientific Research

Research has shown potential benefits in several areas:

- Improved focus and concentration
- Reduced stress and anxiety
- Enhanced meditation practice
- Better sleep quality
- Increased creativity

However, more research is needed to fully understand the long-term effects and optimal usage patterns.
